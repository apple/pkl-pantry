/// Prometheus supports two types of rules which may be configured
/// and then evaluated at regular intervals: recording rules and alerting rules.
///
/// To include rules in Prometheus, create a file containing the necessary rule statements
/// and have Prometheus load the file via [Configuration.rule_files].
///
/// The rule files can be reloaded at runtime by sending `SIGHUP` to the Prometheus process.
/// The changes are only applied if all rule files are well-formatted.
