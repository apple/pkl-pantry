/// The version of the action to run.
///
/// For typed steps, the type of [with] is associated with the major version of the action, so
/// subclasses should specify a fixed version
/// It is strongly recommend to include the version of the action you are using by specifying a Git
/// ref, SHA, or Docker tag.
///
/// Use [sha] to specify a specific SHA to use in place of the version.
/// If you don't specify a version, it could break your workflows or cause unexpected behavior when
/// the action owner publishes an update.
///
/// * Using the commit SHA of a released action version is the safest for stability and security.
/// * If the action publishes major version tags, you should expect to receive critical fixes and
///   security patches while still retaining compatibility.
///   Note that this behavior is at the discretion of the action's author.
/// * Using the default branch of an action may be convenient, but if someone releases a new major
///   version with a breaking change, your workflow could break.
