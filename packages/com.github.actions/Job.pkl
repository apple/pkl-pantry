/// A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs, which run in parallel by default.
///
/// To run jobs sequentially, you can define dependencies on other jobs using the
/// `jobs.<job_id>.needs` keyword.
/// Each job runs in a runner environment specified by runs-on.
/// You can run an unlimited number of jobs as long as you are within the workflow usage limits.
/// For more information, see
/// [Billing and usage](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/billing-and-usage) for
/// GitHub-hosted runners and
/// [Actions limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/limits) for self-hosted runner
/// usage limits.
/// If you need to find the unique identifier of a job running in a workflow run, you can use the
/// GitHub API.
