/// Selects an action to run as part of a step in your job.
///
/// An action is a reusable unit of code.
/// You can use an action defined in the same repository as the workflow, a public repository, or in
/// a published Docker container image.
/// We strongly recommend that you include the version of the action you are using by specifying a
/// Git ref, SHA, or Docker tag.
/// If you don't specify a version, it could break your workflows or cause unexpected behavior when
/// the action owner publishes an update.
/// * Using the commit SHA of a released action version is the safest for stability and security.
/// * If the action publishes major version tags, you should expect to receive critical fixes and
///   security patches while still retaining compatibility.
///   Note that this behavior is at the discretion of the action's author.
/// * Using the default branch of an action may be convenient, but if someone releases a new major
///   version with a breaking change, your workflow could break.
/// Some actions require inputs that you must set using the with keyword.
/// Review the action's README file to determine the inputs required.
/// Actions are either JavaScript files or Docker containers.
/// If the action you're using is a Docker container you must run the job in a Linux environment.
/// For more details, see [runs-on].

/// Commands run using non-login shells by default.
/// You can choose a different shell and customize the shell used to run commands.
/// For more information, see [shell].
/// Each `run` keyword represents a new process and shell in the runner environment.
