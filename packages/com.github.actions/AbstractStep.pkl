/// You can use any supported context and expression to create a conditional.
/// For more information on which contexts are supported in this key, see Contexts reference.

/// When you use expressions in an if conditional, you can, optionally, omit the `${{ }}` expression syntax because

/// You can also set variables for the entire workflow or a job.
/// For more information, see [module.env] and [Job.env].

/// When more than one environment variable is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific variable.
/// For example, an environment variable defined in a step will override job and workflow environment variables with
/// the same name, while the step executes.
/// An environment variable defined for a job will override a workflow variable with the same name, while the job executes.
///
/// Public actions may specify expected variables in the README file.
/// If you are setting a secret or sensitive value, such as a password or token, you must set secrets using the
/// secrets context.
/// For more information, see [Contexts reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts).

/// You can override the default shell settings in the runner's operating system and the job's default using the shell keyword.
