/// When you use expressions in an if conditional, you can, optionally, omit the `${{ }}`

/// However, this exception does not apply everywhere.

/// For example, an environment variable defined in a step will override job and workflow

/// An environment variable defined for a job will override a workflow variable with the same name,

/// Public actions may specify expected variables in the README file.
