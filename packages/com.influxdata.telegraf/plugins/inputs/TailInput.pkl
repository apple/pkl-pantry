/// The tail plugin "tails" a logfile and parses each log message.
///
/// By default, the tail plugin acts like the following unix tail command:
///
/// ```
/// tail -F --lines=0 myfile.log
/// ```
///
/// - `-F` means that it will follow the _name_ of the given file, so
/// that it will be compatible with log-rotated files, and that it will retry on
/// inaccessible files.
/// - `--lines=0` means that it will start at the end of the file (unless
/// the `from_beginning` option is set).
///
/// see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html for more details.
///
/// The plugin expects messages in one of the
/// [Telegraf Input Data Formats](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/DATA_FORMATS_INPUT.md).
