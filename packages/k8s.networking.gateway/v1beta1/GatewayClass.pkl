/// GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
/// Gateway resources.
///
/// It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
/// means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
/// was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
/// propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
/// limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
/// If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
/// Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.
///
/// Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
/// add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
/// associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
/// Gateway is not deleted while in use.
///
/// GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.
