  /// Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define

  /// At least one Listener MUST be specified.
  ///
  /// ## Distinct Listeners
  ///
  /// Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
  /// MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
  /// exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
  /// "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
  /// from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
  /// apply in that case).
  ///
  /// Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
  /// combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
  ///
  /// Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
  /// Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
  /// they support:
  ///
  /// HTTPRoute
  ///
  /// 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
  /// 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
  ///
  /// TLSRoute
  ///
  /// 1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
  ///
  /// "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
  ///
  /// **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
  /// Listener**.
  ///
  /// When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
  /// example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
  /// can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
  /// Listener fields.
  ///
  /// When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
  /// each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
  /// values for other fields.
  ///
  /// The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
  /// The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
  /// Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
  /// Gateway API spec.
  ///
  /// The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
  /// values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:
  ///
  /// * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
  /// * **TCP, UDP**: Port
  ///
  /// One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
  /// implementation:
  ///
  /// * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
  ///   Listeners, and
  /// * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
  ///   Protocol.
  ///
  /// In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
  /// TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.
  ///
  /// If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
  /// previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
  /// accepted.
  ///
  /// Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
  /// Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.
  ///
  /// ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname
  ///
  /// When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
  /// hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
  /// values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
  ///
  /// Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
  /// matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
  /// matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
  /// `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
  ///
  /// Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
  /// wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
  /// For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
  ///
  /// The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
  /// hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
  ///
  /// The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
  /// the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
  /// `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
  ///
  /// ## Handling indistinct Listeners
  ///
  /// If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
  /// Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
  /// condition in the Listener Status to "True".
  ///
  /// The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
  /// purpose of this documentation.
  ///
  /// Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
  /// Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
  /// no Conflicted Listeners.
  ///
  /// Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
  /// the following rules:
  ///
  /// * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
  ///   ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
  /// * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
  ///   contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.
  ///
  /// The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
  /// Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
  /// not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
  /// indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
  /// Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
  /// indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
  ///
  /// ## General Listener behavior
  ///
  /// Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
  /// For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
  /// request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
  /// to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
  ///
  /// This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
  /// of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
  /// clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
  /// `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.
  ///
  /// Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
  /// for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
  /// conformance tests.
  ///
  /// ## Compatible Listeners
  ///
  /// A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:
  ///
  /// 1. They are distinct.
  /// 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
  ///    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
  ///    addresses.
  ///
  /// Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
  /// implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
  /// may not be compatible for another.
  ///
  /// For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
  /// on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
  /// would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
  ///
  /// Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
  /// Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.
  ///
  /// In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.
