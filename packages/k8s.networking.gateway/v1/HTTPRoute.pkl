  /// performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
  /// configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.
  ///
  /// Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a

  ///
  /// 1. IPs are not allowed.
  /// 2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard

  /// If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
  /// must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
  /// attached to the Listener. For example:
  ///
  /// * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
  ///   that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
  ///   least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
  /// * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
  ///   that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
  ///   one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
  ///   `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
  ///   all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
  ///   not match.
  ///
  /// Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
  /// as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
  /// both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
  ///
  /// If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
  /// HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
  /// ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
  /// HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
