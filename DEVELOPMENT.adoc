== Generating actions within `com.github.actions`

The link:scripts/generate-github.sh[generate-github.sh] script generates all actions within the link:packages/com.github.actions/actions/[] subdirectory.
The script fetches action types from https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-actions-typing-catalog[github-actions-typing-catalog] if available.

Sometimes, the latest version isn't available in that catalog.
In these cases, the types for that action must be added directly to link:scripts/actionTypes/[].
To do so:

1. Move the action out of `coreActions` and into `allCoreVersions`, with that version pinned
2. Add a typing for this module within link:scripts/actionTypes/actions/[], which amends `amends "@io.github.typesafegithub/ActionTypes.pkl"`.
3. Re-run the link:scripts/generate-github.sh[generate script].
